///
/// `assert_eq` requires that its arguments implement the `PartialEq` trait.
/// What is a trait?
/// Traits in Rust are very similar to interfaces in other programming languages:
/// a trait describes a behaviour/capability.
/// For example:
///
/// ```
/// pub trait Pay {
///     fn pay(self, amount: u64, currency: String) -> u64
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In practical terms, a trait defines the signature of a collection of methods.
/// To implement a trait, a struct or an enum have to implement those methods
/// in an `impl Trait` block:
///
/// ```
/// impl Pay for TaxPayer {
///     fn pay(self, amount: u64, currency: String) -> u64 {
///         todo!()
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// `PartialEq` is the trait that powers the == operator.
/// Its definition looks something like this (simplified):
/// ```
/// pub trait PartialEq {
///     fn eq(&self, other: &Self) -> bool
/// }
/// ```
/// It's slightly more complicated, with generic parameters, to allow comparing different types.
/// But let's roll with this simplified version for now.
///
/// Let's implement it for Status!
impl PartialEq for Status {
    fn eq(&self, other: &Status) -> bool {
        // If you need to refresh the `match` syntax, checkout
        // https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-02-match.html
        match (self, other) {
            __
        }
