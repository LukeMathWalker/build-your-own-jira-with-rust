/// It's our pleasure to welcome you to the Rust London Code Dojo!
/// You will be learning Rust while building your own JIRA clone!
///
/// The material is structured as a series of exercises, or koans.
///
/// A koan is a riddle or puzzle that Zen Buddhists use during meditation to help them
/// unravel greater truths about the world and about themselves.
///
/// Will you get the chance to unveil deeper insights about yourself during this session?
/// Maybe, maybe not.
/// But we'll try out best to take you from "what is this Rust thing?"
/// to "Look, ma! I can do this programming thing with it!".
///
/// If everything goes well, at the end of the session you will:
/// - have implemented a CLI to interact with a file-based no-server JIRA clone;
/// - know enough about `Rust` and its ecosystem to go on and have fun with it!
///
/// **Practicalities**:
/// - each koan is a sub-folder in the `koans` folder;
/// - each folder contains multiple test files with one or more tests in each of it;
/// - you can move along your journey with `koans --path jira-wip`:
///     - if you have successfully completed an exercise (or you just started this workshop)
///       the console output will ask if you want to move forward and
///       tell you the name of the next koan you should get started with if you say "yes";
///     - if something is wrong with your test cases, the console output will contain
///       the compiler errors or test failures that you should investigate.
///
/// ~ Enjoy! ~

mod tests {
    #[test]
    /// This is your starting block!
    ///
    /// In each test, you are expected to replace __ or todo!() in order to make test pass.
    ///
    /// Sometimes a one-liner (or a literal value) will be enough.
    /// Sometimes you will have to write a bit more to get the job done.
    ///
    /// If you get stuck, don't hesitate to ping us!
