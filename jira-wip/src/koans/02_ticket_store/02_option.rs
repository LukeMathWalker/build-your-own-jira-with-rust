        /// What is an Option?
        ///
        /// In a nutshell, Rust does not have `null`: if a function returns a `Ticket`
        /// there is no way for that `Ticket` not to be there.
        /// If there is indeed the possibility of the function not being able to return a `Ticket`,
        /// we need to express it in its return type.
        /// That's where `Option` comes in (`Option` as in `Option`al, or at least that how I think about it).
        /// `Option` is an enum:
        ///
        /// ```
        /// enum Option<T> {
        ///     Some(T),
        ///     None
        /// }
        /// ```
        /// `T` is a generic type parameter here: as we saw for HashMap, Rust allows you to be generic over the types
        /// in your container.
        /// The `None` variant means that the value is missing.
        /// The `Some` variant instead tells you that you have a value.
        ///
        /// There is no way you can use the value in an `Option` without first checking the variant,
        /// hence it is impossible to "forget" to handle `None` when writing code.
        /// The compiler obliges you to handle both the happy and the unhappy case.
        ///
        /// For more details on `Option`, there is an exhaustive introduction in the Rust book:
        /// https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.29.0/book/2018-edition/ch06-01-defining-an-enum.html#the-option-enum-and-its-advantages-over-null-values
